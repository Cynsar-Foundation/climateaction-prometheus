## What is climate action prometheus ?

This is an effort to understand what is stopping us to work towards climate crisis ---

## Work in progress ?

The current strucutre of the paper provides study/survey about how economic system on planet earth displace 
actions from the agencies that are working to address. In short there is not enough capital allocated to climate 
crisis addressal

## Why?

1. Centralization of resources leads to accumulation of powers in the hands of few that may lead to no action.
2. There are simple solution but world or human relationship that when taken in accounts are far complicated, 
hence no action 
3. Tracking and measurement of the exact loss or quanta in supply chain is still nascent and probably would 
require more time and effort.
4. Local law and international law are biased.
5. Entreprenuers developing products are clearly coming with applications that end up exploiting natural 
resources/ energies by effective efficiency that may lead to long term issues


## More WIP
